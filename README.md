# NeoDiscordBot

## Introduction
This project started by basing my bot off of [Guidebot by AnIdiotsGuide](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot) andis an attempt to make it my own.

## Goals
There's a lot of cleanup to be done, but I will be updating and adding features when I have time! So far it's pretty basic in terms of end-user functionality, but it's designed to be scalable with very minimal downtime. 

Right now, all it can really do is upload a random picture from a local directory, but the directory can be different from server to server!
